# cis4307-lab1-partA--practice-repo

In this assignment, you will practice working with a private repository with a single user (you) making changes to the source files. After cloning this existing repository, you will make changes as specified in the assignment, commit those changes to your local repo, merge, and push your changes to the remote repository.
